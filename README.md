# AR-Dice

## The Goal

Keeping up with the latest trends of the industry, I'll be working on Augmented Reality using Apple's ARKit and SceneKit for creating AR solutions.

## What will be created

Dicee is a simple app that will place a die on the screen where a flat surface is detected, creating the illusion of being in the real world. Also, I've played with the app and placed the moon in the room, How cool! 

## What I will work on

* How to use ARKit.
* Basics of SceneKit
* Addding 3D assets to scenekit.
* Working with colors in a sceneview.
